# 2024-US-Election-Prediction
Attempting to predict the result of the 2024 US Presidential Election using machine learning algorithms trained on historical election data. This is primarily just a small project to practice machine learning.
I am using election data from 1828-2020 as elections before 1828 had less data, as well as the fact that political parties became were more confusing before 1828, and it is much easier to organize the candadites by political party.
